# Entire VM Restore


To restore a VM, Veeam Plug-in for Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager and Red Hat Virtualization performs the following steps:

1. [Applies only if you restore the VM to the original location] Powers off and removes the original VM.
2. Launches a worker in the same cluster where the restored VM will reside.

If no worker is deployed in the cluster, Veeam Backup & Replication launches a worker that is deployed in any other cluster connected to the oVirt KVM Manager.

1. Connects to the oVirt KVM Manager over REST API, configures a VM and creates empty virtual disks in the target location.

The number of empty disks equals the number of disks attached to the backed-up VM.

1. Uses the worker to connect to the repository where backed-up data is stored, retrieves the data and restores it to the empty disks — and then attaches these disks to the configured VM. If multiple disks are attached to the backed-up VM, these disks are restored sequentially, one disk at a time.

If the backed-up VM originally resided on a platform other than oVirt KVM, Veeam Backup & Replication attaches disks with the restored data to the target oVirt KVM VM [in a specific order](bus_type_restore_order.md).

1. Suspends the worker when the restore session completes.

| If multiple VMs are added to the restore session, these VMs are processed in parallel. |
