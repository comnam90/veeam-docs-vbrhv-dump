# Ports


Veeam Plug-in for OLVM and RHV automatically creates firewall rules for the ports required to allow communication between the workers and the backup server.

Workers

The following table describes network ports that must be open to ensure proper communication of workers with other backup infrastructure components.

| From | To | Protocol | Port | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worker | Backup server | TCP | 19000 | Used to communicate with the Veeam Backup & Replication server. |
| oVirt KVM Manager | TCP/HTTPS | 443 | Used to communicate with the REST API service running on the oVirt KVM Manager. |
| oVirt KVM Manager | TCP | 54323 | Used to communicate with oVirt KVM Manager (hosted engine). |
| oVirt KVM host | TCP | 54322 | Used to communicate with oVirt KVM hosts. |
| Veeam backup repository or [gateway server](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/gateway_server.html?ver=13) | TCP | 2500-3300 | Default range of ports used as transmission channels for jobs and restore sessions. For each TCP connection that a job uses, one port from this range is assigned. |
